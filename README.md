The goal is to replicate the mockup of the <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/spec/3e3b745f-aa5a-460e-5fd7-8cc90c248d21-480a/screen/2bce9ed2-c1ed-4a71-ae23-37c1e019d677/Web-1920-1/" target="_blank">prototype link</a> using Bootstrap and HTML and into a fully functioning website
<br>
Peer reviewed by (Zahid Afsar): The website is almost identical to the original in desktop version except for the header img which is only the size of the blue box. Also the website isnt responsive to tablet or mobile on way you can fix this is by using @media screen and (max-width: 800px) or  @media screen and (max-width: 400px). Also you could use the display: none to get rid of something once it gets smaller and make a new one pop up for example a navbar. You could also use min-width instead of max-width. Other than that the website is great and I like how the buttons on the top work.
